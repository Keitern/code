                    <p> 
                        This project centers around the fortress of Landeland and its museum. The main 
                        issue that was presented from the client is that their gait-impaired visitors
                        were unable to enter the bunker-exhibits due to there being stairs, stemming from
                        the cold war. These stairs are difficult to simply remove, as the bunker lie mainly underground, 
                        and serves the purpose of bringing authenticity to the museum.
                        <br> <br>
                        This project showcases the ability to brainstorm and generate different and innovate ideas,
                        the three main ideas that were brought forth was firstly a diorama, secondly a tablet which
                        the guests could use to get information on the bunkers, and thirdly a seperate room on ground
                        level, which would serve as a simulation of the real bunker down below. 
                        <br> <br>
                        After coming up with these ideas, it was quickly found that the combination of these ideas, 
                        would bring the most accessibility for the gait-impaired. This means that we decided to 
                        create an external room showcasing the bunker below, 
                        using projectors and speakers to simulate the feeling of being inside the bunker.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore it was decided that we would make it so people would be able to 
                        navigate the bunker using a tablet with a program running, that would serve
                        as a controller of the room.   
                        <br><br>
                        This was made by my collegue and I Tonny, by learning the coding language Python.
                        From this we were able to swiftly craft a solution that would fit the needs of our target audience,
                        aswell as our client.
